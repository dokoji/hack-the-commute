## Hack the Commute Hackathon: dokoji app 
#POWER POINT PRESENTATION: https://github.com/dokoji/hack-the-commute/blob/master/Dokoji_HackTheCommute.pptx



This application was developed on March 22, 2015 for City of Seattle's hack the Commute hackathon. http://hackthecommute.seattle.gov/

Everyone has experienced the difficulty of arranging a meetup for a group of friends or family members. This issue is magnified in certain communities, specifically the refugee and immigrant communities, that are underserved in terms of digital access - they often lack computers or internet access, and they also are not heavy users of apps. They primarily use their phones to talk and text, so they are not accustomed to using different apps to research, shop, etc.

The dokoji messaging app was created to provide localized, contextual recommendations for dining, entertainment, shopping and more based on the users' text conversation, and integrated directly into the users' conversation. This allows people in these communities to have much richer, informed conversations, which in turn helps them make smarter decisions and increase their digital equity. 

Moving out from these communities, we realized that this app could offer the same benefits to everyone - people can use it to more easily plan get togethers- find a place to meet, make reservations, set calendar reminders and keep track of everyone's journey.

The app is currently built out and usable for the functions described above. For Hack the Commute, we integrated data sets that would allow people to explore green transportation options, so once a group of people had picked a destination, they would be presented with 3 options: Find the closest bus using the OneBusAway data set; find the closest bike rental location using the Pronto data set; and a carpool option (future implementation). On the back end, we also integrated impact data from Washington State Department of Transportation.
